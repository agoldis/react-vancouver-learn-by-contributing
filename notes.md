# Learn by Contributing - React Vancounver Edition

## Introduce myself

Hi My name is Andrew. I am a software developer, specializing in javascript ecosystem and web applications. I am new to Vancouver (a bit more than a year) and I work for a local company called Invoice Simple.

## Introduction

Since I was a wandering nerdy teenager and later a professional software developer (10 years or so) I have always been curious about how do I become better, how do I compare myself with others. Am I doing good or bad? How do I measure my "skill", how to distiguish between bad and good developer.

Is it the amount of languages one can write, lines of code, use of abstractions, technologies one can use or maybe time it takes to solve programming trivia questions on a whiteboard?

May be it is years of experience or title that one assigned at a certain company?

There's no good answer for that, but I think the majority of us will agree that there's one very important criteria - the impact of your work.

Person's ability to create a software tool that helps millions others solve their problems.

The engineers that are able to create significant impact are well recognized and respected by the community.

As most notable example, let me mention Linus Tovalds - although being contraversal in his communication, the guy is famous and respected for his dedication and work on Linux. [mention C langiuage creator as alternative]

Talking about Javascript / React ecosystem, there're people that are not as famous as Linus, but still known for reaching almost every React developer in the world:

- Dan Abramov - the creator of Redux (and many others)
- Michel Weststrate - author / maintainer of MobX (and many others)
- Rich Harris - author / maintainer of Rollup and Svelte (and many other)
- [add Backbone author]
- your favorite JS star goes here
- and many others

The interesting part is that you don't have to be the smartest or most knowledgible engineer. It is our ability to recognize important problems and provide simple helpful solutions what matters.

We are all busy - at our workplace, life, and creating and impactful tool seem like too big.

For me personally, the guys that create such great tools are like wizards - I mean how do you even recognize the need for such a tool as Redux or babel?

I seems like noone was born as a "wizard", and it takes tiny steps.

But how do you even start?

By collaborating and contributing to open source project.

It is an excellent opportunity to take baby steps and try to create the impact.

But even if you don't have time or energy to create the next React (Svelte?), it is still very valuable for you.

The JS ecosystem is based on OSS, and that's wonderful - that makes it even easier to start / engage / improve.

Many of us actively use OSS, in my talk I'd like to review why is it good for you to do OSS
